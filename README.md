# Land Price Predictor

This project implements a linear regression model to predict land prices based on two key features: square footage and the number of bedrooms and bathrooms.

Project Overview

Goal: Develop a model to estimate land prices using readily available data.
Data: The project is designed to work with a dataset containing land properties and their corresponding square footage, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms.
Model: Linear Regression is employed due to its suitability for predicting continuous values based on linear relationships with input features.
